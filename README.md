## Shared Exploits and Malware

Sometimes groups will use tools and techniques unique to them. Other times they will use tools that are in the public domain, like open source software, and leverage known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Rather than repeat the same information in each repo that references a shared exploit or malware, they will live here.
